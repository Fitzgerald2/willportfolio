      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        last studio is a website designed to funcion as the porfolio site of a photographer and was specificly built to display images of multiple sizes clearly without causing any problems and altering the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was the first I dveloped using flex box funtion. This is a function that allows me to seperate different items into colums and put them into a project while keeping everything equaly spaced apart.

      <h2>Completing the project</h2>
      <p>
        This was one of the more difficult projects that i've completed due to it using multiple funcions inside each other and having to keep track of the measurments and lenght and width of each image being used. The project also had a system where
        if the user scrolled down a certan amount of pixels on a page, the background colour of the page would change.
