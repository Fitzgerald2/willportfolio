      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project is all about javascrypt and animation.

        The site is a simple one, it is simply a webpage with three buttons. Push one button it goes to the next slide, push the other it goes back to the previouse slide, and if you press the button in the midle it will take you to a random slide.

      <h2>Using javascrypt 6 </h2>
      <p>
        This project is almost all javascrypt. It take advantage of java 6 and animation.

      </p>
      <p>
        Javascrypt 6 is the most recent edion of javascrypt. In this project it was mainly used to create event listeners and if statements. For example one of the lines of code added states that when the user pushes the relevent button, check the
        page
        their on, if they go forward the number will escede the number of slides or it returns a value lower than zero, If the relevent criteria is met then go to the next slide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other thing the javascrypt is used for is to change the colour of the background and the circle on on the page. This is done by asigning a specific colour for each slide so when the slide is reached it changes colour.
